# Algorithms

**Our Motto - No Algorithm/Data Structure is small-o-big.**
- Keeping above in mind, we are focusing on cleanliness, structuring, documentation and usability apart from almighty Big-O-Notation perfromace chase.
- Concepts are habits and like all habits we need to revisit and re-assert them time-to-time.
- We are doing this for not only interviews and exams but to be better at every chance of lackiness we face.

## Pre-requisites
- Please install Postsharp Community using Visual Studio Extensions. Note - make sure Just in time debugger feature is installed(using visual studio installer).
- Next using the installed tool(Tools > Options > Postsharp), register for license as community edition (this will require an email address).
- Annotate all your init method defintions with [DiagnosticAspect] attribute to get the performance of that method call.
